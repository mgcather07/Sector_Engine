//  Source-agnostic dam-generation model. Started life as TVA-only; the shapes

//  was added. Anything TVA-specific stays in TVAGenerationService.
//
//  There is NO national dam-generation feed — coverage is federated across
//  operators and degrades in tiers: some publish a forward schedule with unit
//  counts (TVA, SWPA), some only observed release. `GenerationProvider` is the
//  seam each operator implements; `GenerationService` fans out across them and
//  returns whichever covers the water you're on.
