//
//  CWMSObservedService.swift
//  Sector — Bowfishing Conditions Engine v2
//
//  Observed water data for USACE projects, from the Corps' CWMS Data API:
//  https://cwms-data.usace.army.mil/cwms-data/  (open JSON, no key)
//
//  WHY THIS EXISTS
//  SWPA publishes the generation PLAN — hourly megawatts, nothing measured. So a
//  SWPA tailwater showed a release figure and nothing else: reservoir and
//  tailwater elevations came back nil and their tiles hid. CWMS carries the
//  measured side for the same dams — pool elevation, tailwater elevation,
//  tailwater temperature — so the two together give a SWPA dam the same depth
//  TVA has natively.
//
//  ⚠️ CWMS IS FEDERATED. Every district names its series differently:
//      SWL  Bull_Shoals_Dam-Headwater.Elev.Inst.1Hour.0.Decodes-rev
//      SWT  TENK-…                       (four-letter project codes)
//      LRL  Barren-…
//      SAM  Buford-…                     (Lake Lanier's project is "Buford")
//  Hardcoding a table per district would rot, and no string heuristic turns
//  "Lanier (Sidney Lanier)" into "Buford". So NOTHING here is hardcoded:
//
//    1. `cwmsOffice` comes from the lake directory, parsed from the district
//       named in Michael's research sheet ("USACE Little Rock" -> SWL).
//    2. The project is resolved by COORDINATE — nearest CWMS location to the
//       dam — because coordinates are universal and names aren't.
//    3. The series are DISCOVERED from that project's catalog by pattern, then
//       ranked (revised over raw, hourly/15-min over daily).
//
//  Everything is cached per session: the office location list is large, the
//  catalog lookup is per project, and neither changes while the app is running.
