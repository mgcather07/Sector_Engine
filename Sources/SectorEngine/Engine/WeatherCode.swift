//
//  WeatherCode.swift
//  Sector — Bowfishing Conditions Engine v2
//
//  Pure reconciliation of Open-Meteo's categorical WMO weather code against its
//  own measurements. The code is model-derived and over-reports rain/storm on
//  clear, dry steps (observed: code 95 with precipitation 0 and 0% cloud on a
//  calm night). Everything downstream — the storm gate, the seeability weather
//  component, and the sky factor — must key off the reconciled code, never the
//  raw one, so a single bad categorical field can't tank the score. The
//  aggregator applies this at the top of `evaluate`; the weather adapter applies
//  it again for the display label. Belt and suspenders, by design.
