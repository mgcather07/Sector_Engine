//  Per the project decision, legality is a global denylist + disclaimer rather
//  than a per-state table. Protected/closed-by-default species (paddlefish,
//  American shad, sturgeon) are NEVER auto-recommended as a target; species with
//  known seasonal/state closures ("check") may be surfaced but always with a
//  "verify your local regs" disclaimer. §9.
