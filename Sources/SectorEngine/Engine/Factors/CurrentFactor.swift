//  Current / dam generation (§5.7), tailwater-aware. Lakes/ponds are rarely
//  current-limited (neutral-positive).
//
//  On a tailwater the response is a CURVE, not a slope. Moderate generation is
//  the best case — the current stacks fish on points and seams while the water
//  is still shootable. Settled water scores well but not best (clear, but fish
//  scattered); heavy generation scores badly (muddy, fast, a gate candidate).
//
//  TVA/USACE generation feeds are deferred (per project decision), so when no
//  resolved `generationLevel` is supplied we classify from the live USGS
//  discharge trend. If a tailwater can't be classified at all, the factor is
//  dropped and confidence drops. §3.
