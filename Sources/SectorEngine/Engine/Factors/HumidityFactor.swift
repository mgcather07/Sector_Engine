//  Sector — Bowfishing Conditions Engine v2
//
//  Humidity, scored as FOG RISK (§ new). Humidity on its own barely moves fish,
//  so scoring the raw percentage would be noise. What actually matters to a
//  bowfisher is fog: when the air cools to within a couple degrees of its dew
//  point, fog forms over the water, and fog ends the night — you can't shoot
//  what you can't see, and you can't run a boat blind.
//
//  So this factor is neutral (≈100) on a clear, dry night and only pulls the
//  score down when fog is genuinely likely during the window. It's low-weight
//  (0.03) by design: a tie-breaker, not a driver.
//
//  Pure function: numbers in, FactorScore out.
