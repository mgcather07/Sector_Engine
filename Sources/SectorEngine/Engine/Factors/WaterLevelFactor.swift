//
//  Water level / stage trend (§5.6). Rising water floods cover and pulls fish
//  (and flood-spawners) shallow; a gentle rise is ideal. A hard rain-driven rise
//  is a good *location* signal but its turbidity downside is handled separately
//  by the clarity gate — we do NOT double-count it here (§14). Falling water
//  pulls fish back toward depth; a fast drawdown is worst. Returns nil when no
//  stage trend is available (dropped + renormalized).
