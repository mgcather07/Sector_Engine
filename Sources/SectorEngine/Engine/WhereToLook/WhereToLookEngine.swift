//  WhereToLookEngine.swift
//  Sector — Bowfishing Conditions Engine v2
//
//  Composes 2–4 contextual "where to look" cards from the active signals, in
//  bowfishing priority order (§10): spawn → clarity → current (tailwater) → water
//  temp → moon → wind → level. Everything is framed for SIGHT-SHOOTING — finding
//  fish you can see and reach in the shallows — not bait or the bite. The closing
//  "look for life" line is preserved.
