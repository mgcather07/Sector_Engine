//  Tailwater detection — "is this spot below a dam?", answered from a static
//  roster. Separate from whether that dam is GENERATING right now, which
//  TVAGenerationService reads live; this file only decides whether the current
//  factor applies at all.
//
//  DIRECTION-AWARE (2026-07-08): proximity alone misclassified reservoir spots —
//  the town of Guntersville sits on the LAKE side of Guntersville Dam but fell
//  inside the old 12-mile radius. Each dam now carries the compass bearing of
//  the river LEAVING it; a spot is tailwater only when it's inside the radius
//  AND within ±`coneHalfAngleDeg` of that downstream bearing (rivers bend, so
//  the cone is wide). Within `nearDamAlwaysMiles` of the dam the flag is granted
//  regardless — generation dominates both faces of a dam at that range, and the
//  seed coordinates are only ~2-decimal precise.
//
//  A spot between two chained dams (below Wheeler = the top of Wilson Lake) is
//  tested against EVERY dam in radius, so the upstream dam's cone correctly
//  flags it even when the downstream dam is nearer.
//
//  Pure math (haversine + forward azimuth) — no CoreLocation. Expand the seed
//  list as coverage grows; the engine logic doesn't change. §5.7.

        //     at a dam known to sit downstream. Coarsest of the three, but the
        //     cone is ±75° and these three are all well inside it.
