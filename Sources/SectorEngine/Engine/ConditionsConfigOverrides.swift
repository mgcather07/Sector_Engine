//  Phase 6 Stage 4: the tuning knobs Firebase Remote Config can drive at runtime.
//  ConditionsConfig itself has tuple fields (curves) that aren't Codable and knobs
//  we never want changed live, so Remote Config carries a small TYPED overrides
//  blob instead. The server starts from the compiled ConditionsConfig.default and
//  applies whatever overrides are present — anything omitted keeps its default.
//
//  This is the JSON you edit in the Firebase console under the `conditions_config`
//  parameter. Add a field here (+ apply it below) to expose another knob.
