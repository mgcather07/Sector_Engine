//
//  WaterTemperatureService.swift
//  Sector — modeled lake surface water temperature
//
//  WHY THIS EXISTS. There is no free national real-time lake surface-temperature
//  API. USGS gages (parameter 00010) exist on only a handful of US lakes — a
//  live query for Lake Guntersville returns ZERO temperature sites — and NOAA's
//  buoy/satellite products cover the Great Lakes only. So for ~90% of the
//  waters people bowfish, the number the app shows will be MODELED. That makes
//  the model worth doing properly, instead of the old "water temp = air temp",
//  which is badly wrong at night (a 2 a.m. air reading is far colder than the
//  water it's supposedly estimating).
//
//  THE MODEL. Lake surface temperature has thermal memory: it integrates the
//  last several days of weather, not this instant's air. The standard predictor
//  (air2water / Toffolon 2022 / Mohseni) is a multi-day running mean of
//  daily-mean air temperature. We use its discrete first-order-lag form — an
//  EWMA of daily-mean air temp:
//
//      Tw[today] = Tw[yesterday] + k · (Tair_dailymean[today] − Tw[yesterday])
//
//  k = 0.20/day → thermal time constant τ ≈ 5 days, the right memory for the
//  SHALLOW near-shore water a bowfisher shoots in. Seeded with the trailing
//  7-day mean of daily-mean air temp. Computed on DAILY MEAN (not the night
//  value), so the night estimate needs no diurnal correction — surface temp at
//  night sits near the daily mean once the daytime skin warming has mixed down.
//
//  The gage override (when one is genuinely nearby) is handled upstream in
//  WaterLevelService; this is the always-available fallback layer.
//
//  Lives in SwiftData/Models/ so Xcode auto-includes it.
